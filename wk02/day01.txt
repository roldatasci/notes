Week 2 Day 2 (Day 6) Notes

ML
- representation - extracting structure from data (unsupervised)
- generalisation - making predictions from data (supervised)

ML Problems
- supervised (labeled set of input-output pairs, map inputs to outputs)
e.g. OCR, credit scoring (each observation has  vector of outpt)

- unsupervised (no labels, learn patterns and structure)
e.g. clustering

feature space (predictors)

supervised
- regression (continuous), classification (categorical)
unsupervised
- dimensionality reduction (continuous), clustering (categorical)

inputs - features
outputs - target, response, output, dep. var, labels
row - observation, record

feature vector (or vector of features)
- each observation's value for each dimension/feature

find the right features
- feature engineering

#### WEBSCRAPING

add downtime
use API over just scraping

Selenium allows you to interact with website
