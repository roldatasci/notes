### Presentation

Plan
- what you want to talk about
- consider audience (story most suited)

summarise premise, central question, outcome
3 key takeaways

Simplify
- no nitty gritty
- choose one story line and stick to it
- don't recap everything that happened

Motivate
- motivate audience to want to see what comes next
- classic elements of a story:
	characters
	central conflict and how resolved
e.g.
Ask a question that motivates the story

Illustrate
- slide are visual **aids**
- YOU are the focus
- (good) slides support, bad slides distract (too much of anything)
- make sure you use color-blind safe colors)
- know your venue (is it dark? is it large?)
- if very dark, use dark background with light text
- use large, legible fonts (including figure text)

Execute
- presence: physicality and confidence
- clarity: tone and content
- orient audience (what are we looking at?)
- tuckaway slides (appendices for technical details) at the very end
(only go into these if somebody asks for technical details at Q&A towards end)

NO SUCH THING AS A FAILED DATA PROJECT
